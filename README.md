# form-login-projects

Form Login Projects are web-based projects that use HTML, CSS, and SCSS to create a user interface for logging in to a website or an application. Form Login Projects can design and style the form elements, such as input fields, buttons, labels, or icons, to make them appealing and user-friendly. Form Login Projects can also use SCSS, which is a preprocessor scripting language that extends CSS, to write more concise and maintainable code. Form Login Projects can also add validation, animation, or transition effects to the form login to enhance the user experience and the security.
